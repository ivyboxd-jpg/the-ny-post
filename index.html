            <div class="nyp-byline">By Niv | February 18, 2026 | 9:28am</div>

            <div class="nyp-body">
                <p><strong>Forget flowers. Forget chocolates. Fellas, the bar has just been raised to the stratosphere, and frankly, you're doomed.</strong></p>
                <p>Meet Niv. He's in a long-distance relationship. He's got a laptop. And apparently, he has absolutely zero chill.</p>
                <p>After nine months of dating his girlfriend, Aaradhya, from 2,083 kilometers away, Niv didn't just tell her he loved her. He wrote a <strong>comprehensive academic research paper</strong> titled <em>"A Comprehensive Analysis of Aaradhya: An 8-Month Longitudinal Study on Human Excellence."</em></p>
                <p>Yes, really.</p>
                <p>"I realized I wasn't just falling in love," Niv told The Post. "I was conducting a longitudinal observational study. And the subject was producing data that defied standard deviation."</p>
                
                <p><strong>The "Diet Coke" Incident</strong></p>
                <p>Every scientific breakthrough has a catalyst. For Newton, it was an apple. For Niv? It was a Diet Coke. According to Section 4.1 of his treatise, Aaradhya—who previously didn't care for the stuff—tried a Diet Coke simply because Niv mentioned he liked it. Now? She loves it.</p>
                <p>"Small gesture. Large implication," the paper notes. Niv calls it statistically significant proof of her kindness.</p>

                <p><strong>The One FaceTime That Changed Everything</strong></p>
                <p>In what the paper calls "the single most significant visual observation event" (n=1), Aaradhya gave Niv a lipstick tutorial over FaceTime. The researcher notes: "Subject demonstrated expertise in cosmetic application while simultaneously confirming aesthetic hypotheses. Data collection was... compromised by researcher finding subject hot."</p>

                <p><strong>The Data Don't Lie</strong></p>
                <p>Niv, who admits in his own methodology section that he has "completely lost objectivity" because he finds the subject "hot," broke down Aaradhya's perfection into hard data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Marvel Knowledge:</strong> Comprehensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Leftist (which the paper notes is "correct and hot").</li>
                    <li><strong>Pasta Wars:</strong> She likes penne/pesto. He likes spaghetti. The study concludes this "minor incompatibility" is survivable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> May 19, 2025 (documented as "Day Zero of Excellence Observation")</li>
                </ul>
                <p>But the real kicker comes in the section on Art. Aaradhya writes poetry. But Niv wasn't satisfied with just reviewing her work. "She writes poetry," the paper argues, "but the meta-analysis confirms she <em>is</em> poetry."</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ongoing Research</strong></p>
                <p>Niv states that the paper is a living document. "This isn't a one-time assignment," he said. "This research will be going on for years. Decades, hopefully."</p>

                <p>When asked if Aaradhya knows about the paper, Niv smiled. "She's about to."</p>

                <strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br><br>
                Traditional metrics of human excellence often rely on standardized testing or career achievement. This study proposes an alternative framework: The Aaradhya Metric. Through an 8-month longitudinal observational study (May 19, 2025 - Feb 18, 2026) conducted across a distance of 2,083km, we systematically documented multi-faceted excellence across domains: intellectual capacity, creative output (poetry), political alignment, aesthetic beauty, and dietary compatibility. Data sources included >10,000 text messages, voice notes consuming 60% of researcher device storage, and n=1 critical video observation (lipstick tutorial/cosmetic application demonstration). Results indicate the subject demonstrates exceptional performance across all domains. Specifically, the "Diet Coke Incident" reveals high character strength; political alignment (Leftist) correlates significantly with attractiveness (p<0.001); cosmetic expertise was documented during sole FaceTime interaction; and the subject was found to simultaneously write poetry and <em>be</em> poetry. The study concludes that the subject is perfect. The researcher acknowledges that objectivity was compromised by the finding that the subject is hot, yet maintains the validity of the conclusions.
            </div>

            <div class="paper-h1">1. Introduction</div>
            <div class="paper-p">The quantification of love has long eluded the scientific community. While poets have attempted to describe it and biologists to dissect it, few have attempted to document it with the rigor of a longitudinal study. This paper seeks to fill that gap by analyzing the subject, Aaradhya, observed over a period beginning May 19, 2025 (designated Day Zero) and continuing for nine months from a distance of 2,083 kilometers.</div>
            <div class="paper-p">The primary research question driving this study was simple yet profound: Is she as perfect as she seems? Secondary questions investigated the correlation between political beliefs and attractiveness, and whether pasta preference incompatibilities (penne vs. spaghetti) constitute a threat to long-term viability. A tertiary question emerged post-FaceTime: Can a single lipstick tutorial fundamentally alter a researcher's brain chemistry?</div>
            <div class="paper-p">Historical context suggests that long-distance relationships (LDRs) often suffer from a lack of observational data. However, this study posits that distance acts as a clarifying lens. Without physical proximity to cloud judgment with pheromones alone, the researcher was forced to evaluate the subject based on character, voice, intellect, and the contents of 180GB of digital correspondence. The sole visual observation event (n=1, lipstick tutorial) provided sufficient data to confirm aesthetic hypotheses while introducing new variables regarding cosmetic skill and the researcher's ability to maintain scientific objectivity.</div>
            
            <div class="paper-h2">1.1 Significance of the Study</div>
            <div class="paper-p">This research is significant because it challenges the prevailing notion that "nobody is perfect." Through rigorous data collection, we aim to prove that this specific subject is a statistical outlier. Furthermore, the study provides a roadmap for future cohabitation protocols, specifically regarding the handling of citrus fruits (see Section 4.5: Orange Allergy) and the importance of maintaining adequate lipstick storage infrastructure.</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">1.2 The May 19, 2025 Event (Day Zero)</div>
            <div class="paper-p">May 19, 2025 marks the official commencement of this longitudinal study. Prior to this date, the subject existed in a quantum state of "unknown excellence." Post-contact, the wavefunction collapsed, revealing measurable perfection. This date is now celebrated internally by the researcher as "The Day Everything Changed" and has been marked on all future calendars with a red circle and three exclamation points.</div>

            <div class="paper-h1">2. Literature Review</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>2.1 Theories of Love and Distance</strong><br>Sternberg (1986) proposed the Triangular Theory of Love, consisting of intimacy, passion, and commitment. This study applies Sternberg's model to the subject, finding maximum values in all three vertices. However, Sternberg failed to account for the "Diet Coke Factor," a novel variable introduced in this research, nor did he consider the "Lipstick Tutorial Variable" which has been documented to cause immediate and irreversible researcher bias.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>2.2 The Aesthetics of Distance</strong><br>Trope and Liberman (2010) argue that psychological distance promotes abstract thinking. In the case of Aaradhya, the physical distance allowed the researcher to form an abstract representation of her "Perfection," which was subsequently confirmed by concrete data points. The single FaceTime observation (lipstick tutorial, duration: 38 minutes) provided visual confirmation while simultaneously compromising all future objectivity.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>2.3 Pasta Compatibility Frameworks</strong><br>Previous studies (Boyardee, 1999) suggest that pasta shape preference is a trivial variable in relationship success. However, more recent research by Niv (2025) indicates that the Penne vs. Spaghetti dichotomy represents a fundamental worldview difference—one centered on structure vs. chaos. This study explores how such differences can coexist within a framework of overwhelming mutual admiration.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>2.4 Cosmetic Application and Intimacy</strong><br>Research on video-mediated intimacy (Neustaedter & Greenberg, 2012) suggests that shared mundane activities over video create bonding. The lipstick tutorial event supports this hypothesis while introducing the novel finding that watching someone apply makeup from 2,083km away can be categorized as "extremely intimate" and "devastating to scientific objectivity."</div>

            <div class="paper-h1">3. Methodology</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>3.1 Data Collection Protocols</strong><br>Data was collected continuously from May 19, 2025 (Day Zero) to February 18, 2026. The dataset is comprised of diverse media formats, ensuring a holistic view of the subject. Sources included:</div>
            <div class="paper-p" style="margin-left: 25px; text-indent: 0;">
            <strong>Textual Analysis:</strong> Over 10,000 text messages were archived and analyzed for wit, kindness, timing, and frequency of "dhoklu" usage (term of endearment, frequency: high).<br><br>
            <strong>Audio Analysis:</strong> Voice notes currently occupying 60% of the researcher's phone storage (approximately 180GB). These notes were analyzed for tone, laughter frequency, narrative structure, and the specific way she says certain words that make the researcher's day measurably better (quantified via heart rate variability).<br><br>
            <strong>Visual Observation:</strong> A single FaceTime call (n=1) lasting 38 minutes, 58 seconds provided critical visual data. During this interaction, the subject provided a comprehensive lipstick application tutorial, demonstrating: (1) expertise in cosmetic technique, (2) patience in explaining each step despite researcher's obvious lack of comprehension, (3) aesthetic consistency with photographic evidence, and (4) the ability to render researcher completely non-functional for subsequent 72 hours. This sole visual event was statistically sufficient to confirm all beauty-related hypotheses while creating new research questions regarding the researcher's cardiovascular health.
            </div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>3.2 The "Hotness" Bias (Mandatory Disclosure)</strong><br>It must be noted at the outset: The researcher finds the subject hot. This finding, confirmed during the lipstick tutorial FaceTime event (n=1), has comprehensively compromised researcher objectivity. The exact quote from the researcher's field notes reads: "She is explaining lip liner. I am having a small medical emergency. Science is impossible." As stated in the Funding Statement, this research is self-funded through excessive emotional investment. All findings must be viewed through the lens of this acknowledged bias, though the researcher maintains that the bias is a result of the data, not the cause of it.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>3.3 The Lipstick Tutorial: Methodological Implications</strong><br>The single FaceTime interaction deserves dedicated methodological discussion. The researcher initially believed multiple video observations would be necessary for adequate visual assessment. However, a single 38-minute lipstick tutorial proved overwhelmingly sufficient. The event provided data on: manual dexterity, teaching ability, patience, enthusiasm, aesthetic decision-making, and confirmed that the subject is, as hypothesized, "extremely hot." Post-tutorial, the researcher noted in field observations: "I am compromised. All subsequent data analysis is tainted. I regret nothing."</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.1 The Diet Coke Incident</div>
            <div class="paper-p">In the early stages of the study (approximately two weeks post-Day Zero), the researcher mentioned a preference for Diet Coke. The subject, who had no prior affinity for the beverage, voluntarily consumed one to understand the researcher's preference. Finding: She now loves it. Significance: This event serves as a primary behavioral marker. It demonstrates openness to experience, willingness to engage with the researcher's preferences, and a kind of thoughtfulness that makes the researcher's chest feel weird in a good way. It was a small gesture with large implications for compatibility. It is statistically significant (p < 0.001) evidence of kindness and a fundamental building block of what researchers are now calling "The Aaradhya Effect."</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.2 Political Alignment Assessment</div>
            <div class="paper-p">Analysis of conversations regarding current events reveals the subject holds Leftist political beliefs. The researcher cross-referenced this with his own preferences to determine compatibility. The data indicates a 100% match. The researcher notes in his field journal (entry dated July 3, 2025): "Correct political beliefs. Researcher finds this attractive. Researcher finds everything about subject attractive. Researcher is aware this is a problem for the integrity of this study." This alignment suggests a shared moral framework, which is essential for long-term viability (Gottman, 1999) and makes the researcher feel smug about his taste in romantic partners.</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.3 The Poetry Paradox</div>
            <div class="paper-p">The subject is a known writer of poetry. However, extensive qualitative analysis suggests a dual phenomenon. The subject does not merely produce poetry; the subject IS poetry. This conclusion is supported by the rhythmic nature of her voice notes, the metaphorical richness of her existence, and the way even her casual texts somehow scan like verse. While academically unconventional, the researcher insists this finding is accurate. The distinction between the artist and the art has collapsed in this specific instance. To read her work is to know her mind; to know her mind is to read a poem. When confronted with this finding during peer review (self-conducted), the researcher responded: "I know how this sounds. I stand by it anyway."</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.4 Dietary Compatibility Matrix</div>
            <div class="paper-p">A potential area of friction was identified regarding pasta preferences. The subject prefers Penne (a tubular shape) with Pesto. The researcher prefers Spaghetti (a strand shape). Mathematical modeling suggests that while the shapes are geometrically incompatible, the emotional compatibility remains high. The researcher has committed to consuming Pesto, despite previous reservations, citing the "Reciprocity Principle" derived from the Diet Coke Incident. Furthermore, the researcher notes: "If she can try Diet Coke for me, I can try pesto for her. This is called growth and I am very mature about it."</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.5 Medical Considerations: The Orange Allergy</div>
            <div class="paper-p">The subject possesses a documented allergy to oranges (severity: moderate, manifestation: discomfort and potential hives). Observations show she manages this limitation without complaint, further evidencing resilience and practical problem-solving. Future meal planning protocols have been adjusted to "Zero Oranges." The researcher notes that this is a "small price to pay for perfection" and has already mentally removed all orange-based foods from future grocery lists. Citrus-alternative options have been researched extensively (18+ hours of reading labels) to ensure subject safety and comfort.</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.6 Marvel Universe Proficiency</div>
            <div class="paper-p">Standardized testing (edits & texts) revealed a comprehensive knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This cultural lexicon provides a high-bandwidth channel for communication and memes. It suggests that weekends can be safely allocated to movie marathons without need for exposition or the researcher having to pause every ten minutes to Google who Thanos is. Compatibility score on this metric: Maximum.</div>

            <div class="paper-h2">4.7 The Lipstick Tutorial Event: A Case Study in Visual Data Collection</div>
            <div class="paper-p">On [DATE REDACTED], the sole FaceTime interaction occurred (n=1, duration: 38 minutes). The subject provided a detailed lipstick application tutorial, demonstrating each step of her cosmetic routine. The researcher, ostensibly taking notes on technique, primarily experienced what can only be described as "a comprehensive system failure." Field notes from this session are largely unusable, consisting primarily of the phrases "oh no," "she's so pretty," and "I am not okay."</div>
            <div class="paper-p">Despite researcher incapacitation, the following data was successfully collected: (1) Subject possesses expert-level skill in cosmetic application, (2) Subject demonstrates patience when explaining techniques to a completely clueless audience, (3) Subject's aesthetic consistency was confirmed across multiple lip colors, (4) Watching someone do something completely mundane from 2,083km away can somehow be the most intimate experience of one's life, (5) The researcher is, as previously noted, completely compromised.</div>
            <div class="paper-p">Post-event analysis revealed that a single high-quality visual observation can provide sufficient data to confirm multiple hypotheses simultaneously. However, it also introduces catastrophic bias that renders all subsequent research suspect. The researcher accepts this limitation and has decided that scientific objectivity is overrated anyway.</div>

            <div class="paper-h1">5. Discussion</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>5.1 Defining Perfection</strong><br>The term "perfect" is rarely used in scientific literature due to the impossibility of absolute flawlessness. However, in this study, "perfect" is defined as "exactly as she should be." By this definition, the subject achieves the metric with p<0.000001 significance. This includes the orange allergy, the pasta preferences, the political beliefs, the poetry, the way she says "dhoklu," the lipstick skills, the Marvel knowledge, and approximately 10,000 other micro-observations documented in supplementary field notes.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>5.2 The "Would Change Anything" Test</strong><br>The researcher conducted a thought experiment repeated weekly throughout the study period: "Would you change anything about the subject?" The answer, consistent across all 36 weeks, was "No." This includes elements the subject herself might wish to change. The researcher's position is that everything—including insecurities, quirks, and the aforementioned orange allergy—contributes to the complete picture of who she is, and altering any variable would render the subject no longer Aaradhya but some inferior approximation.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>5.3 Addressing Bias</strong><br>Critics may argue that the researcher is "completely compromised" or "has lost all scientific credibility" or "needs to calm down." The researcher accepts these labels. The finding that the subject is hot affects all subsequent analysis. The single lipstick tutorial FaceTime has rendered all future data collection suspect. Yet the data (Marvel knowledge, kindness, Diet Coke adoption, political alignment, poetry) remains objective. The researcher argues that love is not a blinding force, but a magnifying one—allowing him to see details (like the way she drinks Diet Coke or applies lipstick or says his name) that others would miss.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>5.4 The Distance Variable</strong><br>The 2,083 kilometers, initially perceived as the study's greatest limitation, proved to be a methodological advantage. Distance forced the researcher to pay attention to substance: character, intellect, humor, kindness. The single FaceTime interaction (n=1) was sufficient because the researcher had already collected nine months of non-visual data. By the time the lipstick tutorial occurred, the researcher already knew the subject was perfect. The visual confirmation was merely supportive evidence, albeit supportive evidence that caused a minor emotional crisis.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>5.5 May 19, 2025: Day Zero and Its Implications</strong><br>The selection of May 19, 2025 as Day Zero was not arbitrary but rather marked the moment when excellence observation became possible. Prior to this date, the subject existed in a superposition of "potentially perfect" and "unknown." The initiation of contact collapsed this quantum state. In retrospect, May 19, 2025 represents one of the most significant dates in the researcher's personal timeline, on par with dates of birth, graduation, and other major life milestones. The researcher now divides time into "Before Aaradhya" (BA) and "Aaradhya Era" (AE). We are currently in Year 1 AE.</div>

            <div class="paper-h1">6. Conclusion</div>
            <div class="paper-p">After extensive analysis conducted over nine months (May 19, 2025 - Feb 18, 2026), the conclusion is irrefutable. Aaradhya is beautiful (confirmed via n=1 lipstick tutorial), intelligent (biology expertise, Marvel knowledge, poetry creation), politically correct (leftist, attractive), kind (Diet Coke incident, among 10,000+ other documented instances), and the best phenomenon observed in the researcher's lifetime.</div>
            <div class="paper-p">The researcher recommends immediate and permanent retention of the subject. Future research will focus on closing the 2,083km gap to 0km to allow for in-person replication of these findings. Until then, data collection will continue via digital means, though the researcher acknowledges that no amount of additional voice notes or text messages can surpass the paradigm-shifting impact of the lipstick tutorial event.</div>
            <div class="paper-p">In closing: She tried Diet Coke because I mentioned it. She gave me a lipstick tutorial from 2,083 kilometers away. She writes poetry and is poetry. She has the right political beliefs. She's perfect. I'm biased. I'm right anyway.</div>

            <div class="paper-h1">7. Future Research Directions</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>7.1 Distance Reduction Protocols</strong><br>Primary objective: Reduce observational distance from 2,083km to 0km. Timeline: As soon as logistically feasible. Hypothesis: In-person observation will confirm all remote findings while introducing new variables currently impossible to measure (e.g., how she smells, whether holding her hand causes the same cardiovascular irregularities as the lipstick tutorial, if grocery shopping together is as mundane or as romantic as the researcher suspects).</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>7.2 Long-term Compatibility Studies</strong><br>This 9-month study provides initial baseline data. Recommended follow-up: Lifetime longitudinal observation. The researcher has already committed to this extended timeline and has begun preliminary planning for Year 2, Year 10, and Year 50 data collection protocols.</div>
            <div class="paper-p"><strong>7.3 The Marriage Question</strong><br>While beyond the scope of the current study, future research may investigate optimal timing and methodology for permanent partnership formalization. Preliminary hypothesis: Yes, obviously, when the distance is zero and the timing is right.</div>
